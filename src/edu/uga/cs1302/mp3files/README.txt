This directory contains the partial implementation of the
SimpleArrayList class.  You will imlement the missing methods 
of the SimpleArrayListIterator class.

The files included in this directory are:


  SimpleArrayList.java	   	     - the SimpleArrayList class (partially implemented)
  DemoSimpleArrayList.java	     - a demo of the list operation
  DemoSimpleArrayList.log 	     - log output of the the DemoSimpleArrayList program
  DemoSimpleArrayListIter.java       - a demo of the list iterator operation
  DemoSimpleArrayListIter.log	     - log output of the the DemoSimpleArrayListIter program
  				       note, that the hasNext method always returns true and 
				       DemoSimpleArrayListIter throws an exception; 
				       you should provide a correct version of hasNext, 
				       which would eliminate this problem
  README.txt			     - this file

You should copy SimpleArrayList.java into your Project4 directory and
place it in a suitable package (you may simply put it in
edu.uga.cs1302.mp3files, or create a separate package for it).  

REMEMBER to add the package declaration at the top of the SimpleArrayList.java!
